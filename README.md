## 📁 Components Description

### 🗃️ `sql_scripts/`
- `schema.sql`: Creates star schema with `dim_patient`, `dim_location`, and `fact_appointment`
- `healthcare_bi_queries.sql`: Analytical SQL queries using **CTEs** and **window functions**

### 🐍 `python_etl/`
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for:
  - Cleaning original Kaggle dataset
  - Converting raw columns (e.g. yes/no, datetime)
  - Creating CSVs for Tableau

### 🧼 `cleaned_data/`
- Final output of cleaned, transformed tables ready for analysis

### 📊 `tableau_dashboards/`
- Tableau Workbook files (`.twb`) for interactive visualization

## 📌 Dataset Source

> [Kaggle: Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Patients **without SMS reminders** had a **higher no-show rate**
- Long wait times (more days between scheduling and appointment) increased the no-show likelihood
- Patients with **chronic conditions** like **diabetes** and **hypertension** showed slightly higher no-show behavior
- Some patients missed appointments **repeatedly**, highlighting the need for intervention
